Enter in your Firebase URL and the plugin will generate a live table of your data. This is especially useful if your Wordpress site is collecting form data using firebase as it provides a way to view the table easily instead of going to firebase itself.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
1. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)
